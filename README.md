# firefox_tabs_to_clipboard
A browser extension made for FireFox (it won't work with Chrome) that copies all tabs (in the current window) to your clipboard whenever you hit it's icon

I didn't bother supporting Chrome because I'd need to rework it for Manifest V3 for that, and I doubt anyone will use this anyway
